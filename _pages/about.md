Hi 👋, I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate  at the University of Adelaide, supervised by
[Prof. Bohan Zhuang](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=DFuDBBwAAAAJ) and
[Prof. Qi Wu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aKXe1FEAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research focuses on developing **efficient and scalable AI algorithms** for multimodal learning and image generation. Previously, I have worked on the following topics:

- **Efficient MLLMs across inference, training, and post-training**, including  [ZipVL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08584), [OmniSparse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12201), and [Sparsity Forcing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18579).

- **Efficient autoregressive image generation**, including [ZipAR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04062) and [NAR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10696).

Currently, my research focuses on **embodied learning**, with an emphasis on **efficient VLA** and **sandbox-based world models**.
